# Discord-Bot
A discord bot with numerous functionalities. The bot is written in Python and uses JSON files for persistent data storage. I created this mainly
to learn how to use the discord.py library.

Some examples of the bot's functionalities:
- Mathematical calculations, such as prime factorization
- Randomizers, such as a coinflipper or random selection
- Encryption and decryption using an encryption key
- A few games, such as a quiz game, type test, and blackjack (unfinished, will move Blackjack over to another separate bot)
